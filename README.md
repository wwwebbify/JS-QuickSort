# QuickSort
A sorting function  -  O(N log N)

Uses a pivot value to sort the passed array in to higher and lower arrays. Then recursively sorts the higher and lower arrays.


NOTE: This function is well suited for sorting a list of unique integers. Merge Sort is generally better suited for unique strings. However, if you have a list is string and/or integers which contains more than about 5% duplicate values, Hash Sort is generally MUCH more performant.
